# Lua Console
This plugin for Obsidian adds a Lua interpreter (via [wasmoon](https://github.com/ceifa/wasmoon)).  

The possibilities are endless.  

## Installation

Not currently available through Community Plugins; only available here for now.  


## Planned Features

- Print more info when Lua starts (e.g. `_VERSION`)
  - `print("'".._VERSION.." | Lua Console (Obsidian) 1.0.0'")`
- Scroll though previously submitted code using up/down arrows
- Syntax highlighting on the input code (if possible)
- Object inspection
- Parsing notes for Lua codeblocks and executing them
- ~~Consider using the Lucide "moon" icon instead of "code"~~
- Possible short-cut wrappers for vault manipulation and metadata extraction/change
  - Note API
- Add examples to this README
